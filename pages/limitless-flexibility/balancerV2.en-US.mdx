Modular. Flexible. Future-proof. Balancer is a one-stop shop for liquidity provision. 

Unlike other technologies that leverage only one kind of AMM logic, Balancer has been designed to be modular and flexible, allowing users to access a one-stop shop for liquidity provision. 

## How does it work?

While other exchanges have pools with constrained parameters, Balancer V2 Tech can accommodate pools of any composition and underlying math. Balancer allows for anyone to develop their own pool type, opening the door for customized pricing functions in trading pools.

Balancer brings powerful new features such as the Vault and SOR to slash gas costs, super-charge capital efficiency, unlock arbitrage with zero-token starting capital, and open the door to custom AMMs.


## Key Benefits

### Unlimited flexibility
Balancer innovated the DeFi space by opening the door to a customizable AMM design. Unbound by the limits of specific AMM logic, Balancer hosts multiple different pool constructs that offer users a flexible and customizable Decentralized Exchange.

### One stop shop
Imagine a suite of DeFi products all rolled into one seamless user experience. From Weighted and Boosted Pools to LBPs, Balancer V2 offers a suite of unique DeFi primitives that unlock the full potential of Decentralized Finance. No longer must users traverse between multiple different DEXs.

### Built for all
Whether you are a trader, investor, or protocol, the underlying technology of Beethoven X allows everyone to participate in the future of finance. Balancer V2 offers unique features that leverage efficiency, optimize swaps, and unlock permissionless and fair token launches.

### Built for the future
Balancer V2 is so much more than a DEX. It is the very foundation that DEXs build off. It is a technology developed for an evolving future, a future that is both unpredictable and constantly in motion. The future is uncertain, those that can adapt will be the ones who prosper.

### Secure
Safety and security is our number one priority and Balancer Smart Contracts are some of the most battle-tested contracts in DeFi. Alongside rigorous security audits, Balancer and Beethoven X have an ongoing 1000 ETH bug bounty which is among the largest in DeFi.

### Pioneering Architecture
The unique architecture of Balancer V2 allows for a plethora of innovative avenues of exploration. By separating the AMM logic from token management and accounting, Balancer V2 can accommodate any system that satisfies a few requirements. Anyone is able to build a custom pool and plug directly into existing liquidity.
