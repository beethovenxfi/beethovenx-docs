# Gauge Vote
_Rewarding participation for users. Efficient incentives for protocols._

The gauge vote is an efficient mechanism for directing BEETS emissions to Liquidity Pools on the Fantom DEX. Users who hold Beethoven Xâ€™s governance token, fBEETS, unlock the ability to participate in a vote to determine which specific pools 50% of the BEETS emissions flow to every two weeks. 

Protocols/DAOs offer gauge bounties for users to vote for their pools, users can then vote on snapshot and claim these rewards every two weeks. The Gauge vote unlocks a capital-efficient mechanism for protocols/DAOs to incentivize their own pool, as Gauge bounties historically yield a positive ROI on $ in emissions/ $ bribed. 

## Protocol Bounties and Gauge Caps

Since the implementation of BIP-24, Beethoven X also offers Gauge Bounties for users to vote for Gauge pools that actively contribute to more than 2% of the previous month's protocol fees. Gauge Pools contributing to less than 2% of the month's previous Fantom protocol fees will are capped at 1% of the vote allocation.

This mechanism aims to ensure the protocol continues towards its mission of longevity and sustainability.

| Pools contribution to previous months Fantom protocol fees | Cap placed on Pool | Max % of Gauge vote  | Protocol bounty |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------- | --------        | 
| <2% | Yes | 1% | No | 
| >2% | No  | 100% | Yes |

The bounties that these pools receive are calculated as a weighted average of their contribution towards protocol fees * total beets that flow to fBEETS holders as gauge incentives. (As shown in [protocol fees](https://docs-beta.beets.fi/ecosystem/protocol-fees))


## How does it work?

* 50% of the BEETS farm emissions are decided by the fBEETS gauge vote bi-weekly. The remaining 50% of the emissions are distributed as base farm weights.
* Voting takes place via Snapshot as a weighted vote. fBEETS in the wallet or staked on BeethovenX qualify.
* Voting begins every other Thursday, a wallet snapshot takes place randomly within a week of the vote.
* Protocols / DAOs announce their gauge incentives, these are shared on the Beethoven X discord and Twitter. 
* Users select the pool they would like to vote for on Snapshot. 
* Users earn a percentage of gauge incentives in correlation to the ratio of their vote within the pool they voted for.
* Gauge incentives will either be airdropped into users wallets or claimed via third party sites.
* The following Wednesday, the updated farm emissions go live. 

**Note**

_The fBEETS pool's emission percentage is fixed at 33.33% and will not be part of the gauge vote._

_5% of BEET emissions are reserved for bonding._

## What are the requirements to add a pool to the gauge?

Community pools can be requested to add to the gauge vote, provided the following requirements are met:

* TVL above 20k.
* The maximum weight discrepancy of the pool is 80/20.
* Pool must be owned by the Beethoven multi-sig (0xCd983793ADb846dcE4830c22F30C7Ef0C864a776), this is the default owner when creating a pool through the UI
* The BPT contract needs to be verified (see Pool Verification in docs).
