Harness the power of Decentralized Governance.

## Goveranance

Bringing power back to the people, fBEETS unlocks the ability for users to influence the evolution of the protocol through decentralized governance.

fBEETS are the key to governance power on the protocol and are essential for participating in BIPs (Beets Improvement Proposals) and emission allocations through Gauge Votes.

Additionally, a portion of the total protocol fees flows to users who stake an fBEETS position in the form of a Gauge Bounty. This mechanism ensures users actively contributing to the protocol can claim BEETS bounties via engaging in the Gauge Vote.

## How to participate?

The primary source of liquidity for the BEETS token is the Fidelio Duetto 80/20 pool on Fantom. Users can create an fBEETS position by entering the Fidelio Duetto liquidity pool and staking their position.
