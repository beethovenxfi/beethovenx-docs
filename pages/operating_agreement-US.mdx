XI.4      Indemnification. The Company shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless any person who was or is a party defendant or is threatened to be made a party defendant, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the Company) by reason of the fact that they are or were a Member, Token Holder, or Authorized Representative, against expenses (including attorney’s fees), judgments, fines, and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if the Members determine that such person acted in good faith and in a manner they reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interest of the Company, and with respect to any criminal action proceeding, have no reasonable cause to believe their conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit, or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of “nolo Contendere” or its equivalent, shall not in itself create a presumption that the person did or did not act in good faith and in a manner which they reasonably believed to be in the best interest of the Company, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that their conduct was lawful.

The law applicable to the UKJT Rules shall be the law of the Republic of the Marshall Islands and any proceeding conducted under the UKJT Rules shall be virtual unless the interested parties agree otherwise. The Members, Token Holders, and Authorized Representatives hereby acknowledge that they are waiving their right to have such a dispute be decided by a court of law or a jury, and it will be instead decided by an arbitrator or otherwise in accordance with the UKJT Rules. All parties shall initially share the cost of arbitration, but the prevailing party or parties may be awarded attorney fees, costs and other expenses of arbitration as determined by the arbitrator(s). All arbitration decisions shall be final, binding and conclusive on all the parties to arbitration, and legal judgment may be entered based upon such decision in accordance with applicable law in any court having jurisdiction to do so.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have adopted this Agreement as the Effective Date by signing below by way of Governance Resolution and in accordance with Section III.3.
