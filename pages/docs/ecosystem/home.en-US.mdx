Beethoven X began its journey on the Fantom network in October 21’. Since then the protocol has taken the journey cross chain and deployed on Optimism in July 22’. For the time being these networks provide the foundations for our ‘home’ and we are committed to building  successful deployments centered around community, sustainability and profitability. 

The expansion across multiple chains has been carefully considered and future deployments on other networks remain as a possibility.  It is important to note that the project will only act out of the best interest of both the protocol and the community.  Any further deployments will need to align strongly with the strategic growth of the protocol, long term and embrace the core values of our brand.
