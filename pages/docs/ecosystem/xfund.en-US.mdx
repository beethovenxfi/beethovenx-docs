## Philosophy 
Beethoven X launched the X fund as a means to come together as a collective to re-imagine what it means to be part of a global community. More than a protocol, Beethoven X is deeply rooted in community development,  collaboration and giving back to the beautiful planet that sustains us. 
Beethoven X stays rooted in the dream where true wealth - wisdom, health, family and love is  centered as a priority. A world where we no longer need to fight for survival.  A world where access to abundance and freedom are gifted to everyone. A world where harmony and balance with nature are truly embraced and systems of sustainability as opposed to systems of extraction are the norm.

## Impact
The X fund is a funding initiative rooted in Sacred Economy. Understanding our role in the modern context and the role of crypto and DeFi, the paradox of accessibility to capital flow has never been so prevalent. Our proximity and distance to capital is both simultaneously within and without our reach. So what does it mean to redistribute, what does it mean to create systems that flow where barriers to entry were not a limitation?

Being part of a team that reimagines aid systems, we choose to move into trust. We choose to create systems that acknowledge agency and celebrate human integrity. There are 3 key principles the X Fund embodies.

1. Unapologetically Generous
2. Decolonial and Embodied Decision Making
3. Conviction over Convincing

## Key Responsibilities
The X Fund focuses on 2 key responsibilities: **Environmental** - Leave No Trace (LNT) and **Social** - Above & Beyond (A&B).

**Leave No Trace** is a simple mitigation process of team and protocol carbon emissions each quarter by investing in nature based capturing such as forestry and regenerative agriculture and in technological solutions such as direct carbon capturing with over 10,000 years of permanent storage.

**Above and Beyond** looks to our cultivation of community support by distributing our funds to social organizations around the world that address social issues pertinent to the experiences of life endured through circumstance. These organizations can range in topic, issue, country and mission.

## Funding and Distribution ****
.......... 

These funds are then used to support the projects chosen by the team members each quarter. A portion of the funds are used for environmental sustainability (LNT)  and a portion for social support (A&B).

Team members are encouraged to connect with their communities, their heritages, their lineages of pain and wisdom and connect with organizations with social missions that are relevant and meaningful.

These organizations are then presented to the team and enter into an embodied decision making process to decide on fund allocation and distribution. 

Our promise is to understand and measure our  impact on the climate.. We continuously strive to reduce our footprint and directly capture what we can't avoid as well as contribute to the peoples of our planet in need. Unapologetically.
