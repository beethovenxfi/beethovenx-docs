# BEETS Launch

The BEETS token was launched utilising the innovative Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool (LBP)
The Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool was allocated 2% of the Total Max Supply of BEETS (5,000,000 BEETS)

* 5M BEETS tokens was distributed using a Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool (LBP) in October of  2021. 
* The LBP ran for 24 hours and was open to anyone.
* The LBP is not like a regular weighted pool. The price started very high to disincentivize bots, front-running, and speculation. Over time, the price automatically decreases by design.
* Below is a graph that shows the BEETS/USDC pool weight starting at 95/5 (with a high BEETS price) and declining to 80/20 (lower BEETS price) over 24 hours.
* At the end of the 24-hour period, the funds were transferred from the LBP into an 80/20 BEETS/USDC weighted pool.
* The LP tokens received by the development team for making the initial pool will be deposited into the BEETS/USDC farm on behalf of a vesting contract was time-locked for 180 days. The farm rewards will not be vested.
