The Reliquary is an evolution of the MasterChef contract, offering an alternative solution to the shortcomings of the vote escrowed model. Through the use of financial NFTS, the Reliquary offers users the freedom and flexibility to build sustainable positions over time that align users' incentives with the desired outcomes of the protocol in a more ethical manner.

## How does it work?
Instead of users needing to lock a position to gain voting power and boosted emissions, the Reliquary incorporates a concept known as maturity. The Relic persuades users / DAOs to earn additional incentives/governance power by cultivating a position over a given time period. The longer a position is held the more potent it becomes. Maturity is broken down into various tiers or tranches with each tier progressively unlocking more rewards. 

Both emissions and voting power will scale up as users approach a higher level of maturity until the maximum level of maturity is obtained. Users will not obtain maximum emissions nor voting power at the creation of the Relic, they must obtain the different levels with time, trust and patience. The key here is that users are not forcibly locked and can exit their positions whenever they choose.

For the fBEETS position the Maturity levels for both voting power and emissions are as such:

## Key Benefits 

### Freedom and flexibility 
The Reliquary allows users to deposit LP positions within a Relic; unlike ve mechanisms a Relic can be exited at any time. Instead of users needing to lock a position to gain voting power and boosted emissions, the Reliquary incorporates a concept known as maturity where positions develop over time.

### Encouraging inclusivity
DeFi unlocks the ability for everyone to engage in a fast, fluent, and fair financial system. We foster new relationships when everyone participates in a system collectively. The Reliquary allows users to engage and participate in the beauty of decentralized governance without having to lock away hard earned funds.


### Protocol and Community alignment
The Reliquary fosters a system for protocol alignment that is more reflective of the community we are trying to cultivate. Users who have faith in the future of Beethoven X are more likely to wait for positions to reach full maturity. This model ensures those who are engaging in protocol governance are here to see the protocol succeed. 


### Programmable Creativity
Users can mint infinite amounts of NFTs to deposit to, merge them together or shift deposits from one NFT to the other while still maintaining the correct maturity. As mature relics earn users additional voting power and emissions, those will likely fetch higher prices. Users who hold their Relics until maturity can expect them to sell at a premium on secondary marketplaces.
