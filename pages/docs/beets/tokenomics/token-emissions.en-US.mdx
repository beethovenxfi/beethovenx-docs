# Token Emissions

### Minting
Beethoven X uses the [MasterChef Contract](https://ftmscan.com/address/0x8166994d9ebbe5829ec86bd81258149b87facfd3) contract for the minting and distribution of new BEETS tokens. These BEETS are owned by the MasterChef contract and are minted / distributed following a defined emission schedule. The MasterChef contract is the only contract which has the permission to mint new BEETS tokens and there is no way to transfer ownership of the BEETS tokens - it is immutable. 

### Distribution
As detailed above, 195m BEETS tokens have been allocated for emissions. Of this fraction, 170m tokens (87.2%) have been allocated for liquidity mining rewards and 25m tokens (12.8% ) have been allocated to the treasury. These BEETS are distributed following an emission schedule which takes place over a 4 year period.

Treasury emissions are minted directly to the [Treasury multisig wallet](https://ftmscan.com/address/0xa1e849b1d6c2fd31c63eef7822e9e0632411ada7) . Liquidity mining rewards are distributed to Liquidity providers based on their share of the total liquidity in a given pool.

### Treasury Funds
10% of all masterchef are emitted to the Treasury. 

The Music Director Committee is able to allocate treasury funds within the strict guidelines set by the Beethoven X DAO. Anything that falls outside the Music Directors' parameters must be put forward to a community vote.
