BEETS has a total maximum supply of 250,000,000. Of this maximum supply,  22% or 55,000,000 tokens were minted at launch as an initial supply.
The initial mint was subdivided in 3 categories which is broken down as follows:

| Allocation    | % of Max supply (250m BEETs) | Number of tokens |
| ------------- | -------------  | ------------- |
| Vested Team Funds  | 13% | 32.5m |
| Strategic Partnerships | 7%  | 17.5m |
| LBP | 2%  | 5m |
| **Total** | **22%** | **55m** |

_Note: Of the 22% minted, only 2.65% was put into circulation upon launch, and all other tokens follow the vesting schedule described below._

The remaining 88% or 195,00,000 tokens exist within the [MasterChef contract](https://ftmscan.com/address/0xa1e849b1d6c2fd31c63eef7822e9e0632411ada7) for the minting/distribution of new BEETS tokens and follow a defined emission schedule. Of the new BEETS minted, 12.8% are minted directly to the Treasury multisig wallet and the remaining 87.2% are distributed to farms (according to their weight) as liquidity mining rewards.

The breakdown for the BEETS allocated to the MasterChef is as follows:

### MasterChef Contract
| Allocation | % of Max supply (250m BEETs) | Number of tokens |
| ---------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------- |
| LP Farms   | 68%                     | 170m              |
| Treasury   |     10%                          |       25m           |
|  **Total**           |             **78%**              |      **195m**            |

The table below summarizes the allocation for the total supply of BEETS tokens and the subsequent distributions from the initial supply and the MasterChef contract:
