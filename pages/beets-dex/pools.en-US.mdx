# Custom Pool Types 

With Balancer Technology, the Beets DEX is free from the limitations of a single AMM design and supports multiple pool types, allowing it to evolve and define the unique needs of a rapidly growing market. 

## StablePools 
Stable pools adopt StableSwap AMM, popularized by Curve. This design enables larger trades with minimal price impact, with prices determined by pool balances, the amplification parameter (A), and swap amounts.

Ideally, stable assets would always trade 1:1, following a linear (Constant Sum) curve. However, if one asset loses its peg, this model would cause the pool to drain entirely. To prevent this, the pool must adapt to uncorrelated asset trading rules, best handled by the Constant Product curve.

Stable math combines these curves to allow low-slippage trades while adapting to price changes. The amplification parameter (A) determines how closely the curve mimics Constant Product (A=0) or Constant Sum (A→∞), ensuring efficient liquidity management.

### Rate Provider Integration for Yield Bearing Assets 


This Rate Provider is a specific contract that accounts for the slow appreciation in the value of Yield Bearing (YB) tokens. In a typical stable pool without a rate provider, the two tokens trade at 1:1. Liquidity providers lose out on the yield generated by these tokens, as it is leeched out due to the activity of arbitrage traders.

Beets navigates this problem by integrating a rate provider contract that constantly updates the ratio between the two assets upon any swap. Instead of assuming a 1:1 ratio, the rate provider queries the blockchain and constantly updates to the correct ratio, ensuring LPs maintain exposure to Yield appreciation.


### StablePool Usecase: 

* Highly Correlated Assets 
* Assets and their yield-bearing derivative 


## Weighted Pools
Before weighted pools, liquidity pools were limited to a 50/50 split between two assets. Weighted pools broke this constraint, allowing up to eight assets with customizable weights, revolutionizing on-chain indices and portfolio management.

Weighted pools extend the constant product AMM model (x * y = k) by incorporating variable weights for each asset. Each token’s balance and weight determine its share of the pool, maintaining a constant value (V).

With every trade, token prices shift slightly, incentivizing traders and arbitrageurs to rebalance the pool while generating fees. This design flips traditional index funds—users aren’t paying for portfolio management; they’re getting paid to hold assets in chosen ratios.

### Weighted Pool Use cases:

* 8020 Governance Tokenomics
* Index Style Pool Types 

## Elliptical Concentrated Liquidity Pools
Elliptic CLPs (E-CLPs), built by Gyroscope, allow trading along the curve of an ellipse. Like other Concentrated Liquidity Pools, E-CLPs concentrate liquidity within price bounds but, unlike uniform distributions, offer more flexibility with asymmetric liquidity.

E-CLPs have two key properties: price bounds and an uneven liquidity profile. These features enable highly customizable liquidity profiles, enhancing capital efficiency in expected trading ranges. The elliptical curve allows for asymmetric liquidity, making it adaptable to various trading curves, including Stableswap or constant product. Price bounds further optimize capital efficiency by limiting liquidity to an expected trading range.

* Highly correlated assets that seek low slippage trades

## Boosted Pools
Boosted Pools route 100% of underlying pool liquidity to external yield markets to generate additional rewards while ensuring all assets remain available to facilitate and earn rewards from swaps.

While not tied to a specific AMM model, they often use Stable Math due to its efficiency with highly correlated assets. For example, StablePools can include assets like Aave's yield-bearing DAI (aDAI), USDC (aUSDC), USDT (aUSDT), or Morpho Vault assets like Steakhouse USDC (steakUSDC). The Balancer BatchRouter efficiently handles trades between these assets, ensuring gas-efficient swaps without unnecessary wrapping or unwrapping.

Any ERC4626-compliant token can easily be added to a boosted pool and swapped on Beets.
