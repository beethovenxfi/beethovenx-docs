# Fees
Beets generates revenue through multiple fee mechanisms, ensuring a sustainable and balanced ecosystem. These fees are collected from key activities on the protocol, including swaps, yield-bearing assets, and flash loans. By leveraging these revenue streams, Beets maintains its long-term viability while rewarding liquidity providers and participants. Below is a breakdown of how each fee contributes to the protocol's growth.
## Fee Type

### Swap Fees

Every trade on the protocol incurs a swap fee, which varies by pool based on the underlying assets and AMM logic. A portion of this fee is distributed to liquidity providers, while the rest is collected as a protocol fee for Beets. The protocol applies a percentage-based fee on the total swap fees collected, with this percentage varying across the different networks where Beets is deployed.

### Yield Bearing Fees

When a yield-bearing (YB) token is deposited into a Liquidity Pool on the DEX, Beets charges a fee on the yield generated. This unique protocol fee creates a sustainable revenue stream directly tied to TVL, reducing dependence on swap volume for long-term viability. This mechanism is exclusive to Beets and Balancerâ€”no other DEXs offer this level of flexibility. Similar to swap fees, this interest-bearing fee applies across all networks where Beets is deployed.

### Flash Loan Fee

A small fee is collected as interest if users utilize a flashloan on the protocol.
