# Liquidity Providers 
By providing capital in the form of assets, liquidity providers contribute towards a fundamental function of the DEX - permissionless swaps. To incentivise deep liquidity across the platform, liquidity providers are programmatically compensated with rewards.

On Beets, Liquidity Providers can earn rewards from two sources: Swap Fees and Yield Bearing Tokens.

## Swap Fees 
Anytime a trade takes place on the DEX, the pool that was used to facilitate the trade collects swap fees. This fee is shared amongst Liquidity Providers and the treasury. The swap fee differs from pool to pool depending on the pool type and the underlying assets. Liquidity Providers automatically earn swap fees without having to claim any rewards.

Upon investing in a liquidity pool, users receive Beets Pool Tokens (BPTs) that represent their share of the pool. Over time, the pool collects swap fees from traders, and these fees are reinvested into the pool. The Liquidity Providers’ share of the pool stays the same (BPTs), but the value of the pool increases due to the collection of fees.

Swap fees are a key source of yield for liquidity providers. This yield is automatically reinvested into the pool and users never need to harvest these rewards, instead, the value of the pool will increase.

## Yield Bearing Tokens

Yield-bearing (YB) assets are tokens that continually increase in value due to an underlying yield generation mechanism. Examples include staking derivatives like wstETH, rETH, and stS, which appreciate from staking rewards.

However, staking derivatives are not the only yield-bearing tokens. Any token deposited into a yield-generating mechanism that accrues value becomes yield-bearing. Boosted Pools are a prime example of this.

Liquidity providers exposed to YB tokens on the protocol earn additional revenue through interest-bearing yield. Just like swap fees, the value naturally accrues within the token, and users don’t need to actively claim rewards.
