# Liquidity Providers 
By providing capital in the form of assets, liquidity providers contribute towards a fundamental function of the DEX - permissionless swaps. To incentivise deep liquidity across the platform, liquidity providers are programmatically compensated with rewards. On Beets, Liquidity Providers can earn rewards from two sources: Swap Fees and Yield Bearing Tokens.

## Swap Fees 
Anytime a trade takes place on the DEX, the pool that was used to facilitate the trade collects swap fees. This fee is shared amongst Liquidity Providers and the treasury. The swap fee differs from pool to pool depending on the pool type and the underlying assets. Liquidity Providers automatically earn swap fees without having to claim any rewards.

Upon investing in a liquidity pool, users receive Beets Pool Tokens (BPTs) that represent their share of the pool. Over time, the pool collects swap fees from traders, and these fees are reinvested into the pool. The Liquidity Providersâ€™ share of the pool stays the same (BPTs), but the value of the pool increases due to the collection of fees. Swap fees are a key source of yield for liquidity providers. This yield is automatically reinvested into the pool and users never need to harvest these rewards, instead, the value of the pool will increase.

## Yield Bearing Tokens

Yield-bearing (YB) assets are tokens that continuously increase in value due to an underlying yield generation mechanism. Examples include staking derivatives like wstETH, rETH, and stS, which appreciate from staking rewards, as well as assets like aUSDC, aETH, and aDAI, which serve as receipt tokens for deposits in Aave.

Any token deposited into a yield-generating mechanism that accrues value qualifies as yield-bearing. Boosted Pools exemplify this concept, allowing liquidity providers exposed to YB tokens to earn additional revenue through interest-bearing yield. Similar to swap fees, this value accrues naturally within the token, eliminating the need for users to actively claim rewards.
