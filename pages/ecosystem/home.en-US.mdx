Home is where the heart is.

Beets began its journey as Beethoven X on the Fantom network in October 21’. Since then the protocol has taken the journey cross chain and deployed on Optimism in July 22’. These networks provided the foundations for our ‘home’ until the Fantom to Sonic migration in December 24'. We are committed to building  successful deployments centered around community, sustainability and profitability. 

The expansion across multiple chains has been carefully considered and future deployments on other networks remain as a possibility.  It is important to note that the project will only act out of the best interest of both the protocol and the community.  Any further deployments will need to align strongly with the strategic growth of the protocol, long term and embrace the core values of our brand.

Not only does the technology offer a seamless DeFi experience, but an interwoven and intellectual community shines through at the heart of this ecosystem. Sonic is where we started our journey and it continues to play a pivotal role in the future of the protocol. All governance decisions operate through our governance token - maBEETS which lives native to the Sonic 
ecosystem.
