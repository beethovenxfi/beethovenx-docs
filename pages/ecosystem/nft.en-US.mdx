### Access to the exclusive Ludwig Lounge

NFT holders of one of the listed NFT collections above will get access to the exclusive Ludwig Lounge, a VIP channel on our Discord. The Ludwig Lounge is where the most talented musicians hang out. In Vienna, over 200 years ago, we hung out at Archduke Maxi in his castle. He had a wicked awesome lounge where Haydn and we could play all night. And the parties sir, the parties. We like lounges, we like if people make an effort, go an extra mile, we LOVE Ludwigs and especially the holders of the key to the lounge. The NFT.

In the Ludwig Lounge:
* We drop alpha
* Give you access to beta versions of our developments
* Give away small (and large) gifts such as partner NFTs, whitelist spots and early access to wonderful projects in the Fantom ecosystem

Welcome to the Ludwig Lounge, where the wine flows, the music is loud, people are amazing, markets are up and moons are in sight. (or when they are down, we will bring in some counseling and music therapy).
