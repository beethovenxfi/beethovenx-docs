### Overview of stS on Beets

stS is a liquid-staked token that users receive when they stake S on the Beets platform. The value of stS naturally appreciates in relation to S thanks to native network staking rewards automatically compounded within the token. This token seamlessly integrates with other DeFi applications, enabling users to utilize it across various protocols, including DEXs and lending markets.

### What are the top highlights of stS?

Access to Sonic Network staking rewards: stS will deliver maximum staking rewards.
Max DeFi interoperability: stS design allows for easy integration with all types of DeFi protocols — from DEXs to Lending/Borrowing protocols.
Decentralization: When you stake with Beets, your assets are automatically distributed across a carefully chosen set of validators

### Staking and Unstaking

To stake, users simply need to head to the stS page and select how much S they wish to deposit. Unstaking takes 14 days, in line with the unbounding period for staking on Sonic.
As an alternative to unstaking, users can swap out of stS on DEXs by swapping their stS for S on the Swap Page.

### How does stS unlock Sonic staking rewards?

The stS token accrues staking rewards via delegating the underlying S to trustworthy validators on the network. Validators are curated based on safety (no slashing history, community engagement, track record), and performance (100% uptime).

### What is the stS exchange rate and how does it change?

Every time staking rewards are added to the pool, the stS exchange rate to S increases.

### What are the stS fees?

Due to the management of underlying nodes, validators earn 15% of the overall stS staking rewards. Beets also takes a 10% protocol fee on the resultant rewards after the validator fees. The APY that is displayed on the UI is the APY the user receives (all fees have been subtracted automatically).

It’s worth noting that a portion of all Beets stS protocol fees will be redirected based on the Quarterly Budget. This means that maBEETS holders unlock a continuous source of “real yield” via LST management fees, swap fees, and all Yield Bearing fees on the DEX.

### Has stS been audited?

The stS was audited by Spearbit,  which is one of the leading smart contract auditors and also audited the SFC contract that is used for S staking on Sonic. Audit report are available for review:

### What are the risks of staking?

While Beets has carefully selected and monitored validators, there exists a risk of one or more of the validators being slashed. To combat this, Beets distributes staked S across multiple validators, minimizing the slashing impact arising from the actions of any individual validator.

Although the stS code is vetted and audited there is also always smart contract risk present. There always exists the possibility of malicious users exploiting a vulnerability or a bug in the contract.
