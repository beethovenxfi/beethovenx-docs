# Security 

## Risks 
While Beets has carefully selected and monitored validators, there exists a risk of one or more of the validators being slashed. To combat this, Beets distributes staked S across multiple validators, minimizing the slashing impact arising from the actions of any individual validator. Although the stS code is vetted and audited, there is also always smart contract risk present. There always exists the possibility of malicious users exploiting a vulnerability or a bug in the contract.

## Audits 
The stS contracts are audited by [Spearbit](https://github.com/beethovenxfi/sonic-staking/blob/main/audits/report-cantinacode-sonic-1209.pdf) and [Trail of Bits](https://github.com/beethovenxfi/sonic-staking/blob/main/audits/2025-01-beethovenx-sonicstaking-securityreview.pdf).
