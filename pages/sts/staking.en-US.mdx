# Staking and Unstaking 

To stake, users can head to the stS page and select how much S they wish to deposit. As an alternative to staking, users can swap into stS on DEXs by swapping their S for stS on the Swap Page.

Unstaking stS involves a 14-day unbonding period aligned with staking on Sonic. After initiating the unstake, users will need to return to the UI after 14 days to claim S. For instant liquidity, users can swap stS for S directly on DEXs via the Swap Page. 

Note that swapping IN our OUT of stS may offer a less favorable exchange rate than unstaking, depending on the poolâ€™s liquidity.
