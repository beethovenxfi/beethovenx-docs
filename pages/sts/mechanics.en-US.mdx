# Protocol Mechanics 
stS is a liquid-staked token users receive when staking S on the Beets platform. Its value naturally appreciates relative to S, as staking rewards from validator delegation are automatically compounded within the token. When users stake S, their tokens are pooled into a staking contract, which delegates the total stake to a decentralized network of vetted validators. These validators generate rewards through Sonicâ€™s proof-of-stake consensus protocol, with a portion allocated to the stS staking contract. As rewards accumulate, the value of stS increases relative to S, reflecting the growing value of the pooled stake.

## Key Highlights 

* stS offers users access to Sonic Network staking rewards without any staking infrastructure or delegation management required. 
* Every time staking rewards are added to the pool, the stS exchange rate to S increases.
* stS is fully liquid, meaning you can use stS seamlessly across DeFi Applications to gain exposure to additional forms of yield while earning the underlying staking rewards. 
* stS increases the economic security of the Sonic network, as when staking, S is automatically distributed across a carefully chosen diverse set of validators.
