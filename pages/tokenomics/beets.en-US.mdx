# BEETS
The BEETS token is the cornerstone of the Beets ecosystem, governing the entire tech stack, including the DEX, LST protocol, and validator set. Holders can participate in governance, shape protocol development, and earn a share of revenue generated across these components. By voting on which DEX liquidity pools receive BEETS incentives, users also influence BEETS liquidity distribution while being rewarded for participation.

## Initial Supply and Tokenomics

BEETS was originally launched with a planned maximum supply of 250,000,000. Of this maximum supply, 22% or 55,000,000 tokens were minted at launch as an initial supply and the remaining 195,00,000 were to be distributed using MasterChef contract.

## Quarterly Budgets

Beets emissions are governed by a Quarterly Budget System, designed to provide a flexible and adaptive approach to BEETS distribution on the Sonic network. This system moves away from a fixed emission schedule, allowing governance to adjust emissions in response to market conditions while ensuring sustainable token supply and aligning with community interests.

Each quarter, the Music Director Committee prepares a proposed budget, which is then submitted for approval by Beets DAO. Once approved, the committee manages emissions within the set parameters. Any adjustments beyond their mandate require a community vote, ensuring transparency and decentralized decision-making.
