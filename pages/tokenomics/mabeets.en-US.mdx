# maBEETS
Maturity Adjusted BEETS (maBEETS) empowers users to shape the protocol’s evolution through decentralized governance while earning a share of all protocol revenue. Unlike the traditional vote escrow (ve) model, where voting power depends on lock duration, maBEETS scales voting power and rewards depending on how long a position is held. Users are never forcibly locked and can exit their positions at any time.

maBEETS has 3 core mechanics to understand: 

1) Maturity Adjusted Voting Power and Rewards
2) 8020 Tokenomics 
3) NFT Receipt Token

## Maturity Adjusted Voting Power and Rewards

Maturity Adjusted Voting Power and Rewards are powered by the Reliquary contract—an evolution of the MasterChef contract designed to overcome the limitations of the vote escrow (ve) model. Instead of requiring token locking, maturity determines voting power and rewards based on how long a position has been held. maBEETS maturity increases weekly, reaching maximum maturity at week 11. To unlock the next level of voting power and rewards, users must manually "level up" their positions in the UI. While users can exit at any time, doing so forfeits all accumulated maturity.


## 8020 Tokenomics 

Instead of single staking BEETS into maBEETS, Beets utilizes a weighted pool token (80% BEETS | 20% stS) to power its governance, offering several advantages:

* Unlike single-sided staking, which removes liquidity from circulation, this approach keeps staked tokens active in swaps, increasing overall liquidity.
* The 80/20 model consolidates incentives into a single pool, reducing slippage, deepening liquidity, and enhancing governance efficiency, eliminating the need for fragmented incentives across multiple markets.
* Users benefit from exposure to both of Beets’ product tokens—maintaining asymmetric exposure to BEETS while also holding stS to access Sonic’s native staking rewards.

## NFT Receipt Token 

When users create a maBEETS position, they receive a financial NFT, which serves as a receipt for their position. This NFT dynamically tracks key details such as position size, maturity, voting power, and reward distribution. As a result, maBEETS offers several unique benefits:

* Transferable — Users can transfer, merge, shift, and split maBEETS positions between wallets.
* Secondary Markets — maBEETS positions can be listed and traded on secondary markets.
* Fully Liquid — Users can withdraw liquidity from their maBEETS position at any time.
* Gamified Evolution — As a position matures each week, the corresponding NFT evolves, reflecting its increasing maturity.
